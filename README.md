# Project2
## By Andrea Monnerie, Tyler White, and Alexander Charbonneau

There are four databases that are created and analyzed:
- Crowfunding DB: created a ERD and sql script
- Category DB: extracting categories and subcategories from Crowfunding.xlsx can created an independent DF
- Campaign DB: clean up campaign data and merge Category DB to it
- Contacts DB: did option 1 (Pros: Simple, easy & Cons: using regex (option 2) would be more efficient)
